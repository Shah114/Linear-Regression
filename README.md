Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that can learn from and make predictions on data. **Linear regression** is also a type of machine-learning algorithm more specifically a **supervised machine-learning algorithm** that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points to the most optimized linear functions. which can be used for prediction on new datasets.
